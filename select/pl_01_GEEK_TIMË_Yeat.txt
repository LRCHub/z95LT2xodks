You ain't compared to us
You get bread, or what?
Worst off,
yea we wanna see you worst off
Are you mad? Yes
Are you glad? Yes
Are yo diamonds off,
diamonds off? Yes
I see dead people in my head
You can come outside
we get you chopped
You ain't on our side
we get you flopped
Hers bag Chanel
Punch mag Draco,
trunk full of hunnids
and some drugs its a cokesoon
Yea we could call the priest
Who you gone call?
You gone call police
Why the fuck you fall,
hit ya arteries
How I stand tall?
Cause I'm balling bitch
How I fly high?
Cause I'm balling bitch
How the fuck you died,
turned you into swiss
Frog eye bitch
Open wide bitch
You gone fall off,
you been compromised bitch
Seen, seen ya flying off so far
Moon, compromise,
I ain't making room
No you can't see in
its all got tint
I don't hit the 5,
I hit the 10
We stay at four seasons,
fuck the wynn
3 little piggies,
we coming in
You hand us scissors,
we cut you thin
It's back 2 back geek mode
on time again
(You ain't compared to us
You get bread, or what?)
